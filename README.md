YouTube Data Analysis (EDA)


📘 Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a YouTube dataset to uncover insights 
about channel performance, audience engagement, and video popularity trends. 
The analysis involves identifying invalid data, cleaning, transformation, and visual exploration to draw meaningful conclusions.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.

Identify and handle invalid or missing data.

Explore relationships between views, likes, dislikes, comments, and subscribers.

Visualize key patterns and correlations in audience engagement.


🧩 Key Steps

Data Loading – Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, invalid numeric values (e.g., FALSE, #VALUE!), and data type conversions.

Descriptive Statistics – Analyzing mean, median, mode, and dispersion of numerical variables.

Outlier Detection – Identifying extreme values using the Z-score method.

Grouping & Aggregation – Analyzing average subscribers and engagement by channel.

Visualization – Creating plots to show trends and relationships (bar plots, correlation heatmaps, boxplots, etc.).

Insights – Summarizing the patterns discovered from the EDA.


🛠️Tools and Libraries.

Python

pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn – Data visualization

numpy – Numerical computation
